Before Scrum and Agile

Can deliver any type of project but is most often used for software development

old model
the waterfall model
  1.analysis
  2. requirement specification
  3. design
  4. implementation
  5. testing an integration
  6. operation and maitenance
  
changing requirements affects the deadline
this can not be prevented

the birth of agile

advantage:
  release features early
  make early return on investment
  discover potential issues early
  change requirement often
  simple solutions
  
  
  Manifesto for agile software Development
  
  individuals and interactions over         processes and tools
  working software over                     comprehensice documentation
  customer collaboration over               contract negotiation
  responding to change over                 following a plan
  
  
  
 ##what is agile
 ##agile is a umbrella term for a set of methodologies and framework that share a manifesto and a set of principles
 
 scrum is one such framework
 
 scrum is founded by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland
 
 
 ## what is scrum
 scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products
 
 
 scrum consists of self organising cross functional Teams
 
 scrum Theory
      # interative
      #incremental
      
  scrum theory consists of 3 principles
  
  1. transparency
  2. inspection
  3. adaptation
 
 Scrum values
 commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect.
 
 when the values are lived by the scrum team the scrum pillars of transparency, inspection and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone. 
 
 Scrum is build for complex products it may be overkill for small products such as a simple website
 
 The strenght fo scrum is to learn from past mistakes, improving, making new decisions, makeing changes
 
 inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work
 
 usually 2 weeks is a good time for the sprint but it can be changed to one week
 
 
 four formal events in scrum
      sprint planning
      daily scrum
      sprint review
      sprint retrospective 
 
 
  scrum team roles
  
    scrum master
    product owner
    development team
    
    
   scrum master :
   expert on the scrum rules
   remove team impediments
   help the team to self organise
   facilitate meetings or wherever necessary
   helps team to be more productive
   helps the product owner maximise r.o.i
   
   product owner:
      responsible for creating the product backlog
      prioritise requirements based on business value
      make decisions to maximise r.o.i
      make trade-offs to maximise product value
    
    development team
      build potentially relasable product increment
      self organising & collaborative
      multi-skilled as needed for the project
      expert in their field
      optimum team size is 3 to 9
